There was no clear-cut end to one to let another begin except for the last.
I was designed in French Morocco, trained and tested in France and Japan, put in production first as an applied physicist in the US, then as an industrialist in charge of various manufacturing sites in Spain, China, and Germany. During all that time, I kept learning new languages wondering why I had not gone on to study literature and modern languages when I was 25 years old.  But no matter, I was finally refactored in Spain, where 27 years after getting my American PhD, I went back to school.  This time the topic was Distributed Computing and Big Data. My newly earned Master of Science combined with my earlier PhD opened the door to become a research Scientist at the Barcelona Supercomputing Center, a power-house for high performance computing and big data modeling. I now work in a group, where we do textual analysis, image analysis, automatic captioning, and quite a few other things applied in particular to Cultural Heritage, with the benefit of a first class computing infrastructure. I am loving every minute of it... and on top of it, we get paid for it. -- We are always blissfully open for new collaborations in the CH area so send me a note if you are so disposed.",,,,,,,false,,,,"Network Association",,true,EuropeanaTech;ResearchCommunicators;ImpactClimate,,,,,,,Academia,,,"Research institute",,,zcrm_1482250000029655171,https://www.linkedin.com/in/cedricbhihe?originalSubdomain=cn,false,"Tamara van Hulst"

Before joining the team, Kamila had worked as 3D heritage documentation research associate at the Centre of Virtualization and Spatial Technology at University of South Florida. She holds PhDs in Archaeology from Charles University in Prague and A. Mickiewicz University in Poznan. She has delivered several research projects across research institutions, universities, archives and museums in Germany, Hungary, Poland, Czechia and the USA in which she utilized cutting-edge technology: laser scanning, IBM, and 3D printing. Her achievements in applying 3D modelling and Augmented Reality to the USF Picasso Project were mentioned by the American Association for Advancement in Science. Her main interest lies with utilizing 3D models in teaching and research to make the world heritage globally accessible.
Kamila is actively interested in approaches to heritage interpretation, the relevance of art and archaeological history and paradigms, and scientific methodology. To interpret archival pre-MOLAS documentation of architectural remnants, she combined post-structural theoretical derivatives with spatial analyses and the practical use of CAD, GIS systems, and digital scholarship.

Together with members of the University Museums in Scotland (UMIS) group led by Dr Catherine Eagleton, Kamila works in the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) Covid-19 urgency 'Online teaching and learning with digitised collections in Higher Education contexts' project. Covid-19 has led to a rush by museums and collections to digitise and to create digital content, in parallel with a dramatic shift to online and hybrid teaching and learning by universities.  This rapidly accelerates and expands activity that was already in progress, building on existing and long-standing work, but with many new features. As neither museums nor universities were prepared for this sudden change, this project is carrying out high quality research at speed. It is exploring the opportunities, capacity and barriers for digital engagement with collections, interoperability between institutions, and evaluating the impact of collections-based university teaching that has been pushed to on-line and digital delivery. By capturing case studies and good practice relating to online teaching and learning with digitised collections we hope to offer much-needed support to museums and universities.

In other work, he was the editor of the DCAT Application Profile for Data Portals in Europe and the Asset Description Metadata Schema (ADMS) and was involved in studies related to Linked Open Government Data, information governance, persistent identifiers, Big Data and Research Data. In addition, as a member of various Working Groups at the World Wide Web Consortium, he contributed to the specification of the Data Catalog Vocabulary (DCAT) Recommendation and to the development of best practices for publication of data on the Web. Currently, he is a member of the Data Exchange Working Group at W3C working on a revision of the DCAT Recommendation.
He is a member of the Research Data Alliance, the Europeana Association, the Advisory Board of the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative and the Steering Group of EuropeanaTech.

For the Naturalis Biodiversity Centre he has scanned the Dubois collection as well as many other exceptional objects for educational purposes and off course he digitized the entire Trix (T-Rex). He has become a member of the Blue Shield expert network and with them scanned a church in Groningen. But also many other heritage buildings for different architects.

She examines dress and textiles, not just in terms of their aesthetic appearance but rather as markers of identity. Her most recent research project explored a collection of paintings from the “Lipperheide Costume Library – Fashion Image Collection”, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, which earned her a PhD in Art History. She has a strong interest in Digital Art History, its methodologies and theories, digital research tools and all matters related to digital collections.

Sabine de Günther studied History of Art, Romance languages and Media Studies in Marburg, London and Venice. After obtaining her Master’s degree, she gained practical experience in museums, which included working as part of a European collection indexing project for poster art. In conjunction with the indexing projects “Fashion Photography” and “Fashion in the cartoon” she began focusing more on costume and clothing studies. She worked on the project “Indexing collections” at the Cluster of Excellency “Image Knowledge Gestaltung” at Humboldt University, Berlin. Her PhD-topic “Bildkosmos der Moden: Die Gemäldesammlung des Franz von Lipperheide. Genese – Kontext – Ausgewählte Werke” is continued in her current research.",,,,,,,false,,,,"Network Association",,false,EuropeanaTech;Research,,,,,,,Education,,"Germany, DE",University,,,zcrm_1482250000001989605,,false,"Tamara van Hulst"

""A Self-Organized Learning Environment, or SOLE, can exist anywhere there is a computer, Internet connection, and students who are ready to learn.
SOLE Greece was established in response to the needs of refugee children stranded in Greece. 
Over 20,000 children and their families are seeking relocation in Europe after being displaced due to conflicts in the Middle East. 
Most of these children have been out of school for over a year and some have never been to school. 
SOLE Greece facilitates learning for children ages 6 - 16 in their own language and with content sensitive to their cultural and historical background.

The controlled vocabularies were not so popular in the collection systems. Then in 1991 the museum needed to connect to “The Internet”. Not long after that the department installed a web server and I became the museum's first webmaster, coding web pages with a text editor. When we started publishing the museum’s collections online, our scientists saved tons of time when they got loan requests for specified objects instead of a set of search criteria. In 1995 I made a proposal on behalf of the government that heritage collections should be made available online on the internet. Since then I’ve been engaged in several initiatives regarding digital heritage such as ABM-centrum (an initiative to increase coordination of data from archives, libraries, and museums). I’ve also worked with the top-level domain  dot.museum. Currently I’m a special advisor at the Ministry of Culture and among other responsibilities, I work around digital heritage policies. I still see a need for more extended use of controlled vocabularies and standards in digital heritage. I represent Sweden in the European Commission’s expert group CEDCHE.

At the request of the Patrimoine et Inventaire d’Aquitaine, I organized a virtual exhibition which is still on line : L’aventure créative de Céramique d’Art de Bordeaux (1919-1947). I digitised the six issues of each series (1919-1920 and 1921-1922) of the French magazine, Les Feuillets d’Arts which were said in an advertising “The most beautiful magazine in the world”. Some issues of the second series were translated and published by Condé Nast in the United States and Great Britain that called them “The Living Arts, a portfolio reflecting the literary and artistic tastes of our time”. I created at the end of 2013 a travel and culture blog, City Breaks AAA+, to show that it is easy and pleasant to discover history, heritage, culture and art while traveling.

Over the past two decades, he has worked internationally in public museums, private art collections and image archives in a variety of roles, including photographic studio manager, researcher, curator and collections manager. Driven by keen curiosity and a love of visual culture, Douglas is a passionate advocate for making cultural heritage openly accessible to promote the exchange of ideas and to contribute to a thriving knowledge economy.

As Collections Engagement Manager at Europeana, Douglas supports Europeana’s mission by working with partner institutions to showcase their collections to online audiences. A key element of his work is developing Europeana’s thematic collections, especially on art and photography, to give users access to relevant and high-quality content from the corpus. Douglas's activities include editorial development, content curation and publication, in collaboration with Europeana's network of cultural heritage institutions. Variously as author, editor and producer, Douglas has been involved in the online exhibitions 'Visions of War' (2018), 'An Ecstasy of Beauty' (2017) in partnership with the Finnish National Gallery, 'Art Nouveau: A Universal Style' (2017), 'The Colossus of Leonardo da Vinci' (2016) with Museo Galileo, Florence, and 'Faces of Europe' (2016), a survey of European art from the medieval era to the present day, featured over 100 artworks from 28 countries.

Douglas frequently represents Europeana at public conferences and workshops. He writes regularly for Europeana Pro and developed the blog series Museums in the Digital Age, featuring interviews and insights from culture professionals at institutions such as the Pinakotheken, Wellcome Collection, Slovak National Gallery and Mauritshuis. In a personal capacity, Douglas is currently leading an international survey of open access policies in the GLAM sector in collaboration with Andrea Wallace, Lecturer of Law at the University of Exeter.",,,,,,,false,,,,Alumni,,false,EuropeanaTech;Research;Education;Communicators;Impact;Copyright,,,,,,,"Cultural heritage",,"Netherlands, NL",Archive,,,zcrm_1482250000003199065,https://www.linkedin.com/in/douglaskmccarthy/,false,"Tamara van Hulst"

Obsessed with sources, archives and artists' biographies, her studies focuse mainly on historic aspects of this phenomena and are based on intensive archival research. 
She recently defended her PhD thesis at Utrecht University intitled ""Etrangers, mais habitués en cette ville de Paris"" : les artistes néerlandais à Paris (1550-1700) : une prosopographie and plans to pursue her research on Dutch and Flemish artists in France in the coming years, hopefully in a French or Dutch academic team.
Like her 333 painters and sculptors, she has been living in Paris for more than 10 years with her french partner and her half French- half Dutch son.

I made my way through my working life following my interests and passions. I just did things I liked, and thought would be interesting and exciting.
I worked at promoting reading - I am very much interested in digital possibilities  - and I am now working at my favorite place, a museum.
So the connection between all these kind of jobs is actually quite simple: it is education and communication, the cultural education,  which unites all my jobs.

Today I work as head of education for the Altonaer Museum and Jenisch Haus in the Stiftung Historische Museen Hamburg.
I am a board member of the LAG Kinder- und Jugendkultur Hamburg, responsible for the field schools.

I am also working as a freelancer in the field of reading promotion, often as lecturer about  digital reading promotion, and also at a children reading club.

I teach maths and ICT in high school. 
Teaching is my pasion and I start teaching in 2003. Inclusion on the eTwinning  and Scientix for Europiean Schoolnet platform, was one of the most beautiful and important things for my professional development, because eTwinning and Scientix are major education community in Europe.
1. eTwinning promotes school co-operation in Europe through the use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) by providing support, tools and services for schools. It also provides free professional online development opportunities for educators. With the support of the Ministry od Education in Albania and the regional  education directorate in Fier, I became a local coordinator for this platform and I began to train  the teachers of my city, who strongly supported this platform by embarking on field and online projects. Project themes and courses were tailored to the needs of the community. The co-operation was great including parents, students and various European teachers.
One of benefits and results of this courses and trainning are that teachers can access all the online and on-site events created by eTwinners, and can also create their own.
STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) projects are focuses on the design, implementation and support of pedagogical and technological innovation in educational practice, through work internally in the school and, most notably, through collaborations with numerous educational, research and scientic institutions in Europe.
Albania is a small country but with passionate and innovative teachers. eTwinning mobile app offers users the ability to access eTwinning Live. This is a great opportunity to find their training skills by realizing digital competencies during the co-operation process.Many training help teachers  learn about innovation in the school and classroom through online professional development courses for teachers in primary and secondary schools. and give them a better understanding of the opportunities, risks and challenges presented to children and young people, and their parents and teachers, in the online world of the 21st century. interest in engaging in communities and networks for cultural, social and/or professional purposes also supports this competence.
Every year I teach about 180 students and together we have created and collaborated online, used different tools includes Microsoft programs Onenote, Prezzi, Sway, PowerPoint online and different online games Kahoot ect,  main computer applications such as word processing, spreadsheets, databases, information storage and management, and an understanding of the opportunities and potential risks of the Internet and communication via electronic media (e-mail, network tools) for work, leisure, information sharing and collaborative networking, learning and research. Every students should also understand how ICT can support creativity and innovation, and be aware of issues around the validity and reliability of information available and of the legal and ethical principles involved in the interactive use of ICT
Collaboration with colleagues as  project partners, include other international unions, national academies of several countries, national research centers, and United Nations agencies.    
The developed projects have real-life themes  about a variety of topics such as media literacy, cyber bullying, online relationships, sexting, online hate speech and radicalisation, and will be provided with high-quality resources to address these issues and have come to the aid of both pupils and their parents, helping them to acquire knowledge, digitalization, and exchange of traditions and cultures. During the teaching hours, didactic tools and various digital programs have been used.",,,,,,,false,,,,"Network Association",,true,Education,,,,,,,Education,,,"Secondary education",,,zcrm_1482250000009409701,https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAABudP04B-jwTxfZsDDQz-3QR8r7DJd7pPt4/,false,"Tamara van Hulst"

Terraforming develops educational methodologies and teaching materials combining best practices in contemporary pedagogy with new-media technologies. Most activities of the Terraforming network are related to different aspects of teaching and learning about the Holocaust, antisemitism, antiziganism, and combating xenophobia through media literacy. Through education and public outreach programs Terraforming empowers multipliers such as teachers, librarians, archivists, and other NGO activists, by developing and providing teaching materials and methodologies, facilitating training programs and international exchange of experiences and best practices.

I started -as a side project- the documentation of the Historic Buildings of Hermoupolis, a unique neoclassical city in an Aegean island. National Technical University of Athens got interested in the idea of digital documentation and optimum conservation plaan. The project became a PhD and in 2012 I successfully defended my Thesis with a grade 10/10. The project was named HERMES, (HERitage Management e System). In 2013, the first presentation of HERMeS in Marseille – France won the “Best Paper Award” in a milestone international event, the DIGITAL HERITAGE Conference, with 450 participants. After that, I decided to upgrade HERMeS using open source platform. My effort leaded me in 2015 to the prestigious European Union Cultural Heritage Prize “The Europa Nostra Award,” among 269 proposals. In 2016 I was an invited speaker by European Commission to “Culture Forum”, a major event for culture with 980 participants. I was an invited speaker in “Best in Heritage” event in Dubrovnic Croatia. In 2016, I was a Marie Curie post-doc fellow in Cyprus University of Technology working in the renowned Digital Heritage Research Lab (UNESCO Chair on ""Digital Heritage""). Today, my research effort focuses on creative reusing of Digital Cultural Heritage for education and the possibilities of connecting tangible and intangible Cultural Heritage with digital tools. HERMeS is now part of Best Practice in 2021 Strategy formed by the European Council, and it is expanding in many historic cities.

This career is open to teachers who have an upbringing in a country whose language is the one being taught at school. This is because I was brought up in Sydney, Australia where the official language is English, so that makes me bilingual, English/Italian. I have a Bachelor (Honours) degree in Science with majors in Biochemistry/Microbiology, with an equivalent degree in Biology in Italy. With my innovative approach to teaching, use of eTwinning projects to build 21st Century competences in my classes I was offered the title of eTwinning Ambassador in 2016/17, so I currently promote the integration of PBL into the curriculum with eTwinning and Erasmus+ projects. Recently, with the updating of eSafety and privacy regulations, both schools I work at, namely Liceo Don Gnocchi , Maddaloni (Caserta) and ISISS G.B.Novelli, Marcianise (Caserta) received eSafety European labels. ISISS G.B.Novelli has also become an eTwinning School, a reference school for eSafety, PBL, eTwinning and Erasmus+. This is the third year that  have been working with projects which have a European Cultural Heritage theme and Europeana, Historiana and its offspring fit into this picture nicely. Lately, I have become interested also with the use of AR, VR in eTwinning projects and their future in the education system and ultimately the work force.",,,,,,,false,,,,"Network Association",,true,EuropeanaTech;Research;Education;Communicators;Impact;Copyright,,,,,,,"Cultural heritage",,,Museum,,,zcrm_1482250000012740391,linkedin.com/in/angela-lucia-capezzuto-36b84940,false,"Tamara van Hulst"

With a burning passion for exploration, I love paint and its smell.

I was born in Baghdad and I live in Lausanne in Switzerland which I love very much.

I love colours, and I enjoy playing with them on the fabric of my paintings. Sometimes it’s canvas, others it’s a paper or even wood.

In my childhood I stood tall in front of clay and stone sculptures that were made by my Sumerian ancestors which today provide me with the treasure of inspiration.
 Ancient symbols of an extinct world living on till this very day. 
Inspired by them, I used layers of paint that I make appear ancient to help create the image of a long forgotten time.
Being a designer and having worked in the field of design and decor, has helped me create a painting that is whole, which bring painting, decor and design together.

I am a very anxious artist, maybe it is in my nature, that is why experimenting for me is a type of morphine that I use to reach new ideas and fantasies for my future projects. Each of my works allows the audience to see a unique technique and details that have been thoroughly studied. The audience can drown while admiring the details of the amount of obsessive hours that have been put into my artwork.

I do not hesitate in trying and discovering and I do not stop at one type of canvas or two, I worked on a wide range of types but I enjoy working on a wooden canvas the most, I feel like I am giving the tree it came from another chance to exist. 
I erase its death and give it a part of my soul so it can live. 
I also find that wood allows me to use a wider range of techniques and actually adds a beautiful feeling to the art.
At the beginning of my career I worked on calligraphy to become a calligrapher and then I joined realistic school of art where I worked on ancient Baghdad in its neighbourhoods and walls. At this stage I started reducing colour palate and then shape started to also get less pronounced.",,,,,,,false,,,,"Network Association",,true,EuropeanaTech;Research;Education;Communicators;Impact;Copyright,,,,,,,"Cultural heritage",,,Gallery,,,zcrm_1482250000022551927,,false,"Tamara van Hulst"

Teacher. Since 2012 I have been a permanent teacher in the high school. My teaching discipline is attributable to technology and design. The areas of interest that I am studying to transfer them to my students are mainly: three-dimensional drawing with dedicated software; the use of the 3D printer and augmented reality. I constantly update on the use of new technologies in teaching, attending online courses and in presence aimed at the training of teachers. In particular, in 2019 I participated in the online course ""Digital Cultural Heritage"" (2nd ed.) Organized by the Polytechnic University of the Marche and EDUOPEN.  In 2018 I participated as a trainer at the VI National Meeting ""Virtual Teachers and Teachers 2.0"" in Rome, with a workshop entitled ""From the idea to the project. Prototyping with the 3D printer"". I was selected among the 15 teachers / experts in the European context invited to participate in the ""Design Thinking and Making"" Masterclass from 3 to 5 March 2020 at the University of Maastricht (But unfortunately I had to give up due to the COVID-19 emergency).

-	the ability to break concepts down into manageable chunks, first learnt from running juggling workshops as a teenager;
-	a good eye for design developed through prop and set building for Trestle and Grid Iron Theatre Company;
-	cross-cultural awareness gained through living in India, Spain, Madagascar, Brazil and Germany (MA Social Anthropology, Edinburgh University);
-	an understanding of how to actively engage learners developed through years of teaching English as a foreign language and running video making workshops (Post Graduate Certificate in Education in the Life-long Learning Sector, University of Greenwich);

I am a member of the Europeana Network Association. Climate change and its impact on human-nature relationships is the focus of my studies. Climate change has a great impact on natural and cultural heritage at local, regional and global level. We see it every day and explore it in our professional work. 

Among the issues that I would like to contribute would be those in the field of education, since I have a long experience in this field as well as aspects of identifying issues, barriers that converge between climate change and cultural heritage. 

I have experience in organisational steering committees, and I would also like to contribute to undertaking genuine thematic studies focusing on the impact of climate change on natural heritage. They can be at the local level and I can concretise them for Albania. Cultural heritage impacts a wide range of developments such as tourism, revitalisation of various urban or rural areas, and economic development of a country as a whole. Climate change which has brought a more frequent frequency of phenomena such as floods, storms, intense rainfall, heat waves etc, can also affect the cultural and natural heritage of the country depending on its geographical position. 

Climate change requires climate adaptation to avoid potential losses and I think that the focus of actions should be on identifying the different types of barriers that appear in the adaptation process in order to establish links between the climate change processes and the management of climate impacts in the process of human adaptation to them. It is necessary to create models of action plans, implementation, monitoring and evaluation in terms of adaptation to climate change. Obstacles can be of different types such as socio-economic, institutional, financial, and technical. Various actions can be taken towards these barriers and different strategies can be formulated to improve knowledge about climate change and heritage; raising awareness of the benefits of both natural and cultural heritage; strengthening public support for conservation; development and implementation of climate adaptation and heritage policies, and more.",,,,,,,false,,,,"Network Association",,true,EuropeanaTech;Research;Education,,,,,,,Education,,,University,,,zcrm_1482250000038672429,,false,"Tamara van Hulst"

In his work, Thomas Sagory actively contributes to the study and documentation of a site, and to offer representations that are both scientifically exploitable and faithful to the spirit of the place.

One is the recently completely refurbished Museum of the Mind, Dolhuys Haarlem (Amsterdam Metropolitan Area). The other venue is Museum of the Mind, outsiderart Amsterdam. The complete renewal  Museum of the Mind, Dolhuys Haarlem is awarded with the European Museum of the Year Award 2022. We take the visitor on a tour through ‘the artwork between your ears’. Neurodiversity, equal rights and anti-stigma are at the core of the museum, voiced by people themselves.

Hans is intrigued by stories people tell which materialize in objects and art and leave immaterial and material traces of the human condition. Hans studied Museology in Amsterdam and Oaxaca (Mexico). ‘For me a museum is a social institution that should create societal change and contribute to the improvement of the lives of all. It is a platform that inspires, creating an impact, while reflecting and setting the agenda on what is happening in society’. 

He expanded the museum and its reach considerably in 2016 by founding the Museum of the Mind,  outsiderart Amsterdam at the Hermitage building. Hans felt that works outside the established canon of the Western art world deserve equal prominence -also in the Dutch cultural field- as there was no venue for this art at the time, he felt this field was largely neglected in the Netherlands. Outsiderart is -the name is telling- all about the arts. Although the artist’s background is not entirely irrelevant -as in all art- it is and never should be the sole nor leading criterium. That is the quality of the work. 

Hans other posts include being Chair of the Willem van Genk Foundation, Chair of the Anton Heijboer Foundation. His education includes the Thnk Creative Leadership program. He has published on outsiderart as well as on mental health themed issues and participated in a number of public events.",,,,,,,false,,,,,,true,EuropeanaTech;ResearchCommunicators;Impact;Copyright,,,,,,,"Cultural heritage",,"Netherlands, NL",,,,zcrm_1482250000050008014,https://www.linkedin.com/in/hanslooijen/,false,"Tamara van Hulst"

One of our foundational projects is the immersive exhibition Behind the Wall. Using mobile and AR technologies, we aim to tell the tragic story of the prison in Uherske Hradiste, Czech Republic, where many anti-fascist fighters and innocent Czech patriots were imprisoned, tortured, and even killed by the Nazis and later by the Communists.

We frequently work with non-profit organizations and the commercial sector and often deliver
projects involving education, history, design, and industrial heritage. We are constantly striving to establish new and exciting partnerships and contacts. We want to share our work with the general and professional public through Europeana and enrich our European

In an age of increasing, global digital dependence and integration, my thesis explores from a public history standpoint the impact of evolving digital technologies on the formation, circulation and public consumption of historical ideas and knowledge in contemporary societies. With an understanding of public history in/as performance and drawing across the 'digital sphere', my research considers the significance of Hamilton: An American Musical's performativity, digitality and transmedial engagement with the past. Prioritising both public experience and academic practice, my thesis hopes to encourage new understandings and conceptual frameworks relevant to the public history of today.
Outside of my thesis, I have publications involving sartorial and film & television studies, as well as growing interests involving dance and public memory & agency which have been fuelled by my experience as a dancer and performer.

Revisiting and complementing findings in the field of Art History with the help of recent digital advances in restoration/conservation tools, their analytical processes and use of advanced 3D imaging methods is a crucial element underpinning her academic research. In particular, electronic microscopic digital imaging in the re-examination of pre- and post- restoration results on a range of renowned Croatian and Italian artworks from public and private collections (e.g. analysis of pigment, preparations and coating) is at the core of her ongoing research interests.

As lead researcher she has collaborated for many years with numerous private and public institutions from Belgium, Germany, Italy, Malta and Croatia. In particular, she was lead Art Historian on a range of collaboration projects with the Croatian Conservation Institute (HRZ), the Croatian Ministry of Culture and the chemical laboratory Opificio delle pietre dure, Florence (IT).

As an external expert in the field of European culture and cultural heritage she acts since 2010 as an expert advisor and evaluator for the European Commission executive agencies. More recently she is also Ethics advisor for REA (Research executive agency).

At Leipzig University, he taught electroacoustics and electronic music, followed by research activities in the TASTEN and DISKOS projects, both funded by the German Ministry of Education and Research.
His PhD project MODAVIS aims at the multimodal virtualization of pipe organs and their coupled acoustical environments, resulting in representations for creative, museum and research purposes. In this context, he is developing the new standard for Virtual Acoustic Objects (VAO), a framework for their creation and management, and a platform for an interactive access.
Currently, he is a researcher at the Research Center DIGITAL ORGANOLOGY at the Museum for Musical Instruments of Leipzig University, which holds the second largest collection of musical instruments in Europe. In addition, he is teaching a Master's seminar in Digital Humanities about multimodal research data of acoustical cultural heritage.
His studies in musicology and cultural sciences were supported by the German Academic Scholarship Foundation, as was his exposé and now his PhD project, for which he was awarded with the Frederick R.

Their signature product is a GPS enabled, hands-free audio guide to local culture and heritage for motorists on iconic driving routes. Deborah conceived and has led production and written scripts for a 4-part series, ROAD TRIP: IRELAND, which tracks 7 counties along the Wild Atlantic Way driving route that borders Ireland’s beautiful west coast. The first audio guide in the series, for County Clare, launched and earned international, Irish, and American awards (https://www.roadtripirelandapp.com).
CLARE remains unique in the marketplace in that it combines storytelling, music and literary performances, folklore, history, and interview excerpts on a huge range of cultural heritage topics, all tied together with polished narration read by internationally recognised Irish actors and, of course, Irish humour and wit. The second tour in the series, CORK & KERRY, is nearing completion. These tours have much to do with the preservation of culture and heritage. Content is sourced by trained ethnographers and ethnomusicologists, whose method of interviewing elicits powerful responses. As many of our interview subjects are elders, these oral histories preserve fleeting cultural memories and traditions that might otherwise disappear. In fact, we were invited to preserve all of our audio recordings for CLARE in Ireland’s national music repository. The writing process transforms this content into something new and accessible on a mass scale: even the app user—by listening to the audio tour (and spreading the word)—also keeps these traditions alive.

Deborah recently joined Europeana Network Association and would love to meet others involved in cultural tourism. She’s particularly eager to speak with stewards or overseers of Cultural Routes for potential collaborations, because she believes cultural heritage audio guides could enhance these cross-border journeys immeasurably. She welcomes any and all inquiries and introductions!
